Welcome to my personal website!

<p align="justify">
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political and Social Sciences at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/2019-2020/deppol), working on the VolkswagenStiftung [COVIDEU Project](https://www.covideu.info).
</p>
<p align="justify">
I hold a BA in Political Science and Public Administration by the [Universitat de Girona (UdG)](http://www.udg.edu), an MA in Political Analysis and Institutional Assessment by the [Universitat de Barcelona (UB)](https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/ca/) and a postgraduate degree in Data Analysis also by the UB. My research interests include political behavior and attitudes, far-right politics and quantitative methods.
</p>
<p align="justify">
At the [COVIDEU Project](https://www.covideu.info), along with my colleagues, we investigate the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on public support for the European Integration and public attitudes towards the EU.
</p>
<p align="justify">
My [doctoral thesis](thesis.html) focuses specifically on COVID-19 pandemic effects on citizens' political attitudes and electoral behavior in the aftermath of the pandemic. Also, you can see the research I am currently working on [here](papers.html).
